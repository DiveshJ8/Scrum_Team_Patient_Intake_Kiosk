4. Far Vision: Full Kiosk interface where users can sign in, self-service check in, provide pre-appointment information, fill in their demographics, family and social history, insurance data, consent forms, validate data entered by the user and make these data available to Practice EHR.

5. Near Vision: Creation of the first page of the interface for sign in/up to kiosk. Users can enter name, date of birth, email address. The system queries the database for user signing in and in case the user is not found, then redirects to the signup option. 

6. StakeHolders: 
			Internal: Doctors, Front Office
			External: Patients

7. Real Stakeholder- Front office staff: The staff will be the real stakeholder for this application. This application will decrease the workload of the front office staff, reduce patient-data entry errors, and improve efficiency of check in processes for patients and office staff.

11. Explanation of User Stories Order
The user stories are ordered in sequence of actions the user will perform when checking-in to interact with the application. The user will first login and if there is invalid login information then an error will pop up. They can also then sign up if they are not registered already. When the patient starts filling the intake form, they will view the progress using a navigation bar and be able to jump between sections to fill out information. The patient will start the intake process by filling out personal information such as address, gender, contact information, etc. They will then fill out healthcare insurance information followed by patient health history and consent and liability forms. Once the user enters in all the relevant information and submits the form, they will receive a confirmation and the front desk staff will be notified of the completed check in by the patient.
